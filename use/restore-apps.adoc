summary: Astra can restore your application configuration and persistent storage from a snapshot or backup. Persistent storage backups are transferred from your object store, so restoring from an existing backup will complete the fastest.

Astra Control can restore your application from a snapshot or backup. Restoring from an existing snapshot will be faster when restoring the application to the same cluster. You can use the Astra Control UI or https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/astra-automation/index.html[the Astra Control API^] to restore apps.

//Restoring from a backup can take some time because the data is transferred from your object store. Because of this, restoring from an existing snapshot to the same cluster will be faster than other methods.

NOTE: If you use Helm to deploy apps, Astra Control Center requires Helm version 3. Managing and cloning apps deployed with Helm 3 (or upgraded from Helm 2 to Helm 3) are fully supported. Apps deployed with Helm 2 are not supported.

//DOC-3556
NOTE: If you restore to a different cluster, ensure that the cluster is using the same persistent volume access mode (for example, ReadWriteMany). The restore operation will fail if the destination persistent volume access mode is different.

[NOTE]
===============================
When you create a project for hosting an app on an OpenShift cluster, the project (or Kubernetes namespace) is assigned a SecurityContext UID. To enable Astra Control Center to protect your app and move the app to another cluster or project in OpenShift, you need to add policies that enable the app to run as any UID. As an example, the following OpenShift CLI commands grant the appropriate policies to a WordPress app.

`oc new-project wordpress`
`oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:wordpress`
`oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n wordpress`

.Steps

. Select *Applications* and then select the name of an app.
. Select *Data protection*.
. If you want to restore from a snapshot, keep the *Snapshots* icon selected. Otherwise, select the *Backups* icon to restore from a backup.

. Select the drop-down list in the *Actions* column for the snapshot or backup from which you want to restore.
. Select *Restore application*.

. *Restore details*: Specify details for the restored app. By default, the current cluster and namespace appear. Leave these values intact to restore an app in-place, which reverts the app to an earlier version of itself. Change these values if you want to restore to a different cluster or namespace.
+
* Enter a name and namespace for the app.
* Choose the destination cluster for the app.
* Select *Review*.

//NOTE: If you are restoring an app that has been deleted, choose a different name and namespace for the app than the original name. If the name for the restored app is the same as the deleted app, the restore operation will fail.

//* Choose the destination cluster for the app.
//* Select *Review*.

. *Restore Summary*: Review details about the restore action, type "restore", and select *Restore*.

.Result

Astra Control Center restores the app based on the information that you provided. If you restored the app in-place, the contents of any existing persistent volumes are replaced with the contents of persistent volumes from the restored app.

NOTE: After a data protection operation (clone, backup, restore) and subsequent persistent volume resize, there is up to a twenty-minute delay before the new volume size is shown in the UI. The data protection operation is successful within minutes, and you can use the management software for the storage backend to confirm the change in volume size.
