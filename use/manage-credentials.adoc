= Add and remove credentials
:hardbreaks:
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/use/

Add and remove credentials for local private cloud providers such as ONTAP S3, Kubernetes clusters managed with OpenShift, or unmanaged Kubernetes clusters from your account at any time. Astra Control Center uses these credentials to discover Kubernetes clusters and the apps on the clusters, and to provision resources on your behalf.

Note that all users in Astra Control Center share the same sets of credentials.

== Add credentials

//The most common way to add credentials to Astra is when you manage compute, but you can also add credentials from the *Account* page. The credentials will then be available to choose when you manage additional Kubernetes compute.

You can add credentials to Astra Control Center when you manage clusters. To add credentials by adding a new cluster, see link:../get-started/setup_overview.html#add-cluster[Add a Kubernetes cluster].

IMPORTANT: If you create your own `kubeconfig` file, you should define only *one* context element in it. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/[Kubernetes documentation^] for information about creating `kubeconfig` files.

////
.What you'll need

* You should have the access key ID and secret key for any ONTAP S3 providers you need to add.
* You should have the kubeconfig file for any unmanaged Kubernetes clusters you need to add.

.Steps

. Select *Account > Credentials*.
. Select *Add Credentials*.
. Enter a name for the credentials that distinguishes them from other credentials in Astra.
. Provide the local private cloud information (such as private key file or kubeconfig file).
. Select *Add Credentials*.

.Result

The credentials are now available to select when you add compute to Astra.
////
== Remove credentials

Remove credentials from an account at any time. You should only remove credentials after link:unmanage.html[unmanaging all associated clusters].

NOTE: The first set of credentials that you add to Astra Control Center is always in use because Astra Control Center uses the credentials to authenticate to the backup bucket. It's best not to remove these credentials.

.Steps

. Select *Account > Credentials*.
. Select the drop-down list in the *State* column for the credentials that you want to remove.
. Select *Remove*.

. Type the word "remove" to confirm deletion and then select *Yes, Remove Credential*.

.Result

Astra Control Center removes the credentials from the account.
